My name is Salih. My programming speciality is in the world of Parallel, Distributed, and Unix-derived Systems Programming. 

I am currently a postgraduate student studying Computer Science, and am slated to work for the University of Birmingham upon my course's conclusion.

I have many open source resources, libraries and applications, ranging from interesting & informative to even potentially useful. They should all be under GPLv2 but check to be sure
