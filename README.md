## README

My name is Salih.

I am currently a postgraduate student studying Computer Science, and am slated to work for the University of Birmingham in HPC upon my course's conclusion.

My main specialities are Heterogeneous (Parallel, Distributed) and Unix-derived Systems Engineering (Debian + Fedora + Arch-based Linux distributions, OpenBSD).

I have many open source resources, libraries and applications, ranging from interesting & informative to even potentially useful. They should all be under GPLv2 but check to be sure
