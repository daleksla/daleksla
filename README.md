## README

My name is Salih, a Parallel, Distributed, and Unix-derived Systems programmer (mainly Linux (Arch, Fedora, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu) and OpenBSD).

I am currently a postgraduate student studying Computer Science, and am slated to work for the University of Birmingham in HPC upon my course's conclusion.

I have many open source resources, libraries and applications, ranging from interesting & informative to even potentially useful. They should all be under GPLv2 but check to be sure

See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salih-msa/) for my professional profile
